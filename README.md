# Final-Project-Bootcamp

## Summary
Final Project of my Data-Analysis Bootcamp at WBS Coding School 
Interactive Dashboard in Looker Studio as a data visualization project

## Languages and Libraries Used
Imported a fictitious Dataset from Kaggle in Big Query and connected the processed data to Looker Studio.

## Key Learnings
The exploration of the dataset was performed both in Big Query and in Google Colab (double-checked results and peculiarities) and the different CSV files were joined in BigQuery in order to obtain a single query/view to push or import into Looker Studio.
I organized the dashboard into theme-based pages, each designed to distill essential insights relevant to specific departments. These takeaways are communicated through diagrams, scorecards, and interactive filters. It's always interesting to put oneself in the place of these departments and try to anticipate their informational needs. One of Looker Studio's key strengths is its user-friendliness: once initially set up, it can effectively display complex information without requiring ongoing coding expertiseâ€”something that might be more challenging in environments like Jupyter Lab, especially for users without coding backgrounds.
Ultimately, operating with visualization tools such as Looker Studio helps bridge the gap between technical experts and non-technical stakeholders, empowering everyone to explore, understand, and gain value from their data.

## Challenges Overcame
The search for a suitable dataset turned out to be more tidious than expected. Most datasets were too small or designed rather for ML projects. Even the dataset I ultimately worked with relates to an existing company based in India, but it's values are synthetic impeding actual conclusions. Data retrieved trough an API might represent a more appropriate approach.
